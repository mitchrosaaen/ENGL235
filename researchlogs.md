# Week 1
My name is Mitch, and this is my second quarter here at Pierce College. I have always enjoyed working on computers, doing things ranging from digital design to server management. More recently in my life I have found an interest in motorsports, more specifically drifting. Learning new things and figuring out how things work has always been something I have enjoyed.

Before I started this class, I had no clue what technical writing meant. It was not until the first day of class when we reviewed the type of work this class includes, did I understood what it meant. The readings that we have done so far are further enforcing the ideas and concepts that I learned on the first day.

Going through GitHub's ["Hello World"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial on how to set up a repository was a prime example of good technical writing. It made it easy for a person like me with no prior experience to set everything up. This was because of how it went into specific detail every step of the way, without leaving out any important information that might be important. The use of screenshots and animated pictures helped to make it even easier to know where we were supposed to be.

This week we looked at [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and the [PierceHacker Project](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/) websites. I believe the intended audience for The Programming Historian is the humanist, and their purpose is to provide a central, reputable, and reliable source for information. For PierceHacker, I believe the purpose is mostly the same however the intended audience is narrower, being directed strictly towards students at Pierce. I think the reason these projects are held in a public website is for the sake of accessibility. It is much easier (and cheaper) to find, access, interact, and read things on a website compared to something like a textbook.

This week I have gained a simple understanding of what technical writing means, what it is, how it's used, and what kind of work a technical writer does.
# Week 2
This week we did a mini project, where we built our own Lego design and had to create instructions for our classmates on how to rebuild it. While creating the instructions I realized how important it is to give the reader very small steps, with as much detail as possible both in the descriptions and images. However I had to be careful to keep the amount of words and clutter in the images to a minimum to keep it easy to follow with minimal distractions. Everything has to be straight to the point. I ended up using small text boxes connected to each step-by-step picture to guide the reader through it easily.

While writing my instructions I had to be mindful of who the audience is, which is my classmates. I know that everybody in the class is well educated, and at least a teenager. This means I can use normal to above average vocabulary without having to worry about the reader misunderstanding anything. I could also use a very minimalistic composition because I know that they are capable of maintaining their focus without the need of any crazy attention grabbing designs.

I chose to create my instructions with Microsoft Word. I did this because I am familiar with it and I know that it would be very simple to work with small images and text laid out along a grid. I then printed out the instructions and stapled it together into a multi-page booklet. This seemed to work well because the readers followed along exactly how I had intended it.

This week, I learned more about the basics of GitHub, more about [formatting Markdown](https://github.com/mitchrosaaen/ENGL235/blob/master/markdown.md), and most importantly I got a feel for some of the workflow that technical writing involves. I learned first-hand what it was like to read both good and bad instructions/tutorials. I learned how to turn my instructions into a logical step-by-step guide with graphics.
# Week 3
This week we started the process of putting together a survey to help determine the contents for the PierceHacker project. I found the most difficult part about composing the survey was collaborating. The class was split into several different groups of people. Each group came up with their own ideas, however much of it was conflicting with others. This was an issue because there was minimal collaboration/communication outside of the groups, causing the development of the survey to be quite chaotic. I found the most interesting part about creating these survey questions was the technicality of it. Keeping our audience as our top priority while developing it, from start to finish, was very new and intriguing to me.

Now that we are starting the PierceHacker project, the audience and purpose is becoming a bit clearer to me. The audience is the average Pierce College student, who may or may not be looking for help. Even if a student isn't having any issues with trying to figure something out, there can still be helpful tips/tricks that can be taken advantage of. The purpose is to provide both easy to access and easy to follow information about the things that students are expected to already understand for their classes, who may not fully have a grasp on yet. I think this information is being delivered via a public website to not only keep information easy, free, and accessible for all Pierce College students, but to also serve as a resource that is open for unlimited improvement, something that a textbook can't do.

This week I learned, via hands on workshopping, how to develop an effective survey. Evaluating and applying information that we know about our audience to develop something effective has been a new experience for me.
# Week 4
We have officially sent the survey out! After we get enough results, we are to write an analytical report on the data that we gathered. This isn't a simple task! First, I needed to do research about what exactly an analytical report is. What is the purpose? Who is it for?

After a brief Google search, I found this page, [What Is an Analytical Report](https://penandthepad.com/info-8708712-analytical-report.html), that helped me understand more about what is expected in the upcoming assignment. This article described how analytical reports are a combination of both an informational report and a proposal. An analytical report will include identifying a problem from analyzing data, explaining the methods used to obtain the data, and making recommendations based on the data.

I think what I have learned this week correlates with the first course outcome about identifying and gathering appropriate information for a specific audience. Now that we have sent out the survey, we must create an analytical report. We have been gathering information about analytical reports which is new to me.
