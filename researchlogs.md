# Week 1
My name is Mitch, and this is my second quarter here at Pierce College. I have always enjoyed working on computers, doing things ranging from digital design to server management. More recently in my life I have found an interest in motorsports, more specifically drifting. Learning new things and figuring out how things work has always been something I have enjoyed.

Before I started this class, I had no clue what technical writing meant. It was not until the first day of class when we reviewed the type of work this class includes, did I understood what it meant. The readings that we have done so far are further enforcing the ideas and concepts that I learned on the first day.

Going through GitHub's ["Hello World"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial on how to set up a repository was a prime example of good technical writing. It made it easy for a person like me with no prior experience to set everything up. This was because of how it went into specific detail every step of the way, without leaving out any important information that might be important. The use of screenshots and animated pictures helped to make it even easier to know where we were supposed to be.

This week we looked at [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and the [PierceHacker Project](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/) websites. I believe the intended audience for The Programming Historian is the humanist, and their purpose is to provide a central, reputable, and reliable source for information. For PierceHacker, I believe the purpose is mostly the same however the intended audience is narrower, being directed strictly towards students at Pierce. I think the reason these projects are held in a public website is for the sake of accessibility. It is much easier (and cheaper) to find, access, interact, and read things on a website compared to something like a textbook.

This week I have gained a simple understanding of what technical writing means, what it is, how it's used, and what kind of work a technical writer does.
