# Week 1
My name is Mitch, and this is my second quarter here at Pierce College. I have always enjoyed working on computers, doing things ranging from digital design to server management. More recently in my life I have found an interest in motorsports, more specifically drifting. Learning new things and figuring out how things work has always been something I enjoyed.
