# Here's a ranked list of some Markdown tutorials I found online.

1. The [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
   - This one is the best for me because it serves it's purpose perfectly as a quick and easy to use cheat sheet for when I need something.
2. The [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
   - This page does a really good job of explaining _how_ and _why_ Markdown exists. Very easy to follow and informative, albiet the information isn't required to write Markdown, it is useful to know.
3. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
   - Kind of similar to the Markdown Guide in #2, but it actually provides information on the basic Markdown functions like #1. A good mix of the two.
5. [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
   - I appreciate how this goes step by step to teach you, and I can see how this can be very useful to somebody who is completely unfamiliar with writing in this way, however it does not really work for me because it takes too long to go through.
