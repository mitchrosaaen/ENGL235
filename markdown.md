# Here's a ranked list of some Markdown tutorials I found online.

1. The [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
   - This one is the best for me because it serves it's purpose perfectly as a quick and easy to use cheat sheet for when I need something.
2. The [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
3. [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
   - I appreciate how this goes step by step to teach you, and I can see how this can be very useful to somebody who is completely unfamiliar with writing in this way, however it does not really work for me because it takes too long.
