## Lesson Abstact

Cloud storage services can be extremely useful for many things, including sharing and collaborating. Google Docs is an example of a software that is capable of doing these objectives.

## Lesson Objectives/Outcomes

- Create a sharable link of your document
- How to send the link through various means

## Materials

The materials needed in order to complete this lesson include:

- Laptop/desktop/phone

## Overview

This lesson responds to the many people at Pierce who don't use cloud storage software. Knowing how to use Google Docs is useful for Pierce College students because it is likely that they will be expected to collaborate in a group project.

4. Click send.

Now you shared the document and the recipient has access to it!

#### How to share your document with a link

1. Press the "Share" button at the top right (Make sure your document has a good name).

2. Click the "Get shareable link" button

3. Click the drop down to determine the access that the person has to your document.

4. Click the "Copy link" button.

Now you can paste the link wherever you want.

### How to work with a shared document as the recipient

The recipient of the document is limited to whichever level of access was given from the sender. For example, a recipient with "editing" access will be able to make changes directly to the document. A recipient who only has commenting access will only be able to make suggestions and comments to a document. If a recipient only has viewing access, then no additions/changes can be made.

1. Change your current level of access with the drop down at the top right of the screen. You are limited to the highest level you were originally granted.
